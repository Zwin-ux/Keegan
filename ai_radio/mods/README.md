# Mods

This folder is the home for frequency packs. Each pack is a standalone mod that can replace or extend the default mood pack.

## Current status
The engine currently loads `config/moods.json` only. Until the mod loader lands, test a pack by swapping its `moods.json` into `config/moods.json` and copying stems into `assets/stems`.

## Pack structure
See `docs/MODDING_GUIDE.md` and `mods/example_neon`.
