# Example Neon Pack

This is a sample frequency pack that tweaks the default mood tuning. It reuses the built-in stems, so it should work out of the box.

## Test it now
1) Copy `mods/example_neon/moods.json` to `config/moods.json`.
2) Run the EXE.

This pack keeps the same mood IDs so the tray menu still works.
